# 1. What I learnt

- How to test my project with RSpec.

- How starting a project by writing tests first helps organize the project.

# 2. Contributing

**Contributions of any kind are more than welcome!**

Feel free to open a github issue or a pull request if you come across any typos or bugs, or if you find some parts of the API confusing, or if you would like to suggest a new feature :D!

# 3. ComputerPlayer's mechanism

It is made of a combination of minimax algorithm, alpha-beta pruning, and the heuristic function that is explained here : https://identity.pub/2019/10/16/minimax-connect4.html

```

Returns a `Board` instance with the dimensions `rows_amount x cols_amount`, with each cell containing the value of `empty_disc`.

**_Notes_** :

- `rows_amount` & `cols_amount` must be a `Float`/`Integer` >= 0

- `empty_disc` can be any object.

```ruby
default_board = ConnectN::Board.new #=> 6x7 board

Returns an array of length 3 `[row_num, col_num, disc]`.

The 1st 2 elements represent the coordinates of the cell at which the disc was dropped, the third element is the dropped disc.

`disc` can by any object.

`at_col` must be in the range `0..cols_amount-1`.

**_Notes_** :

- If the given `at_col` refers to a filled column, an exception is raised.

board.filled? #=> false
```

### 4.1.8 #row_at

```ruby
board.row_at(n) -> Array or nil
```

Returns the board's `nth` row.

If `n` is not in the range `0..cols_amount-1`, returns `nil`.

**_Notes_** :

- The 1st row, at (0), is the one in the bottom of the board.

- The row elements are ordered left-to-right.

```

## 4.1.10 #valid_pick?

```ruby
board.valid_pick?(pick) -> true or false
```

```ruby
board = ConnectN::Board.new
board.valid_pick?(3) #=> true
```

# 4.2 Demo

**_Notes_** :

- `Demo`'s purpose is to show all features of the gem and to give you an idea on how you could use it to build your own custom connect_n game.

  opponent_disc:
) -> ConnectN::ComputerPlayer
```

- `min_to_win` : Must be the same `min_to_win` of the `ConnectN::Game` instance.

- `difficulty` : an `Integer` greater than or equal to 0. The higher it is, the harder it is to beat the computer.
